# LSTM Simulation for NOF Theory

This folder will contain the LSTM model for the Negentropic Ocean Field (NOF) Theory, predicting EEG coherence increases (\(\Delta C = 10 \pm 2\%\)). The model uses a 3-layer architecture trained on \(10^6\) EEGDB samples (\(R^2 = 0.87\)). Code and training scripts will be uploaded soon.

## Status
- Placeholder: Awaiting simulation scripts.
