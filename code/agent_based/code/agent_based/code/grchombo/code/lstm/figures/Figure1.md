# Figures for NOF Theory

This folder contains diagrams for the Negentropic Ocean Field (NOF) Theory. Currently, it includes a placeholder for Figure 1, a 2D schematic of the NOF framework depicting the “dark ocean” metaphor with \(\phi\), \(\chi\), \(\Psi\), and triangles. Additional diagrams (e.g., entropy valleys) may be added in the future.
