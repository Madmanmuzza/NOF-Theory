# GRChombo Simulation for NOF Theory

This folder will contain the GRChombo simulation for the Negentropic Ocean Field (NOF) Theory, predicting gravitational wave disturbances (\(\Delta h \approx 10^{-27}\)) detectable by LISA. The simulation uses a \(256^3\) grid with \(\Delta x = 10^{-4}\). Code and configuration files will be uploaded soon.

## Status
- Placeholder: Awaiting simulation scripts.
