# Agent-Based Simulation for NOF Theory

This folder contains the agent-based simulation for the Negentropic Ocean Field (NOF) Theory, modeling societal phase transitions. The simulation uses 10^4 agents to predict entropy spikes (\(\Delta S_{\text{soc}} = 5 \pm 1\%\)) associated with emergent phenomena. The main script, `main.py`, implements the consciousness field (\(\Psi\)) dynamics with stochastic noise.

## Usage
- Requires Python 3.x and NumPy.
- Run `main.py` to simulate agent interactions.
