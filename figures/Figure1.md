# Figure 1: NOF Framework Diagram

This file is a placeholder for the NOF framework diagram, a 2D schematic with a dark blue ocean background. The \(\phi\) field is a flowing tide (curved arrows), \(\chi\) forms reef-like structures (gray clusters), and \(\Psi\) appears as wave patterns (white ripples). Triangles (red outlines) float on the ocean, labeled “Knowledge,” “Biases,” and “Consciousness.” Interaction arrows connect the fields, converging at a unity point.
