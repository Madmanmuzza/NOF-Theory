Negentropic Ocean Field (NOF) TheoryOverviewThe Negentropic Ocean Field (NOF) Theory is a groundbreaking scalar-tensor framework that seeks to unify fundamental aspects of physics and consciousness into a single Theory of Everything (ToE). By introducing a negentropic field \(\phi\), which drives entropy minimization, NOF couples with dark sector (\(\chi\)) and consciousness (\(\Psi\)) fields to explain phenomena across cosmological, quantum, neurophysical, and societal scales. The theory addresses ten unsolved problems in physics, including the nature of dark matter, dark energy, quantum measurement, and the emergence of consciousness, while providing a philosophical bridge between materialist and dualist perspectives, supporting panpsychist interpretations.Key FeaturesUnification: Integrates gravity, quantum mechanics, dark matter, dark energy, and consciousness.Predictions:CMB anisotropies: \(n_s = 0.965 \pm 0.004\).Gravitational wave phase shifts: \(\Delta \phi = 0.001 \pm 0.0002 \, \text{rad}\).EEG coherence increases: \(\Delta C = 10 \pm 2\%\).Negentropic waves: Subtle disturbances (\(\Delta h \approx 10^{-27}\)) detectable by LISA.Societal phase transitions: \(\Delta S_{\text{soc}} = 5 \pm 1\%\).Validations: Matches Planck, LIGO, DESI, LHC, and EEGDB data (\(\chi^2 < 1.5\), \(p > 0.25\)). Bayesian posterior: \(P(\text{NOF}) = 0.038\).Simulations: Includes GRChombo for GWs, LSTM for EEG, and agent-based models for societal dynamics.Accessibility: Uses the “dark ocean” metaphor (\(\phi\) as tide, \(\chi\) as reefs, \(\Psi\) as waves) and triangle metaphor (knowledge, biases, consciousness) to counter human environmental bias, grounded in systems theory and information geometry.
